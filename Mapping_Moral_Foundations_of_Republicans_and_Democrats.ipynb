              "Verona, PA - In trying to shake free from his Etch-A-Sketch persona, Governor Mitt Romney dug his hole further by saying he would \"run as a conservative.\" Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: \"Quite frankly, this is just the confirmation of what we've all suspected, Mitt Romney does not have a set of core convictions. Having now pledged to 'reset' - the question has to be asked, which of his positions will he 'reset'? Abortion? Mandates? Taxes? Guns? Global Warming?\"Mitt Romney: The Consummate Etch A SketchBy Daniel Horowitz, RedState.comhttp://www.redstate.com/dhorowitz3/2012/03/21/mitt-romney-the-consummate-etch-a-sketch/... Aha! That's exactly what we were looking for! There is no symbol that emblematizes Mitt Romney more than an Etch A Sketch.Later in the day, the LA Times reports that Romney clarified the comments of his spokesman by saying that they didn't pertain to ideology, just organization.Though Fehrnstrom was specifically asked about Romney's political positions possibly changing, Romney portrayed the comments as being about his organization. Should he be the nominee, Romney said, the nature of the campaign certainly would change \"organizationally.\" But \"the issues I'm running on will be exactly the same.\"\"I'm running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I'll be running as a conservative Republican nominee,\" he said. \"The policies and positions are exactly the same.\"Um, no. The comments expressed were clearly about political positions, not organization. We all know that in a general election, any conservative must finish his sentences and clearly articulate why limited government policies will help the economy and create upward mobility for all voters; something that might not be required in a primary. But those positions should never change. In Romney's case, he never had any core beliefs anyway, except for his consistent support for government-run healthcare.Look, we understand that the comments emanated from a campaign official and not the candidate himself. But these comments just confirm what we've always known about the people surrounding him. They are all purveyors of pale pastel political positions (alliteration intended). From their perspective, this is just a game of electoral politics; an opportunity to assume power for power's sake.Moreover, Fehrnstrom's comments have struck such a cord with the base because they sum up Romney's history in one image. Whenever he needs to win a particular political office, he resets the slate and pollinates it with whatever positions he ascertains to be politically expedient.Instead of impudently demanding that we get on board the Romney train, maybe his supporters will provide us with some reason to believe that the Mitt Romney in the general election will not hit the reset button. Or maybe the reset button is exactly what we need to wipe away his obstinate support Romneycare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2\n",
              "Diverse Group to Advise Campaign; Mobilize Community for Hillary Hillary Clinton's Nevada campaign today announced the formation of the Nevada LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) Leadership Council, a group of educators, business leaders, and community activists endorsing Clinton's bid for the presidency. The council will advise the campaign on issues relating to the LGBT community and mobilize support for the January 19th caucus. \"Hillary Clinton has dedicated her life to standing up for those who often lack a voice in our society,\" said Judy Corbisiero, President of the Southern Nevada Stonewall Democrats. \"I've admired her intelligence and compassion since her days as America's First Lady. I am confident that she is the candidate with the strength and experience to stand up for the LGBT community as our next President.\" \"The Clinton campaign is fortunate to have the support of these dedicated activists and community leaders mobilizing caucus-goers for Hillary in the Silver State,\" said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. \"The members of this council understand Hillary Clinton's commitment to equality for all Americans.\" Senator Clinton has been a longtime friend of gay Americans, fighting for policies that promote equality, while taking a strong stand against forces that have tried to marginalize the LGBT community. As president, she is committed to passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

              "Verona, PA - We are on the eve of a dark milestone in our nation's history. Two years ago this week, President Barack Obama signed into law ObamaCare, the bill that changed the very core of this country. Two years ago this week, Barack Obama cemented our dependence on government for our health and our very lives. Two years ago this week, Barack Obama took Mitt Romney's advice - and said the government, for the first time in history, could force you to buy something. No matter how badly Governor Romney hopes he can hit the \"reset button\" or shake the \"Etch-A-Sketch\" to clear out the issues he's proclaimed during his campaign, history shows Mitt Romney urged President Obama to use the individual mandate Romney himself implemented - and then was untruthful about it.Unless we elect a nominee who can credibly stand up to the President and say \"no\" to ObamaCare, then more and more of our freedoms will be taken away forever.Starting today - through the oral arguments before the Supreme Court - Rick Santorum and his campaign will expose the dangerous actions of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's role in laying the foundation for this infringement on individual freedom.Rick Santorum said,\"RomneyCare is the fundamental difference between Mitt Romney's campaign and mine. I stand for an individuals' right to make their own decisions about healthcare - Gov. Romney and Barack Obama support the government controlling your healthcare. This election is about our basic freedoms being stripped away. I have the credibility and the record to stand up to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the healthcare issue and say, 'no.'\"I have a fundamental disagreement with Barack Obama and Gov. Romney's philosophy on the proper role of government. Barack Obama on the federal level and Gov. Romney on the state level used their executive authority to expand the government's role in the lives of Americans. Unlike these two men, I believe government should be limited in its size and scope.\"When you run down the list of elements of RomneyCare and ObamaCare, you will see the same characteristics: * Individual Mandate* Employer mandate* Mandatory electronic records* Comparative effectiveness* End of life programs* Medical homesWhile conservatives have been campaigning against ObamaCare, Mitt Romney has attempted to hit the \"reset\" button and \"shake\" the past that he created the framework for ObamaCare. How can we believe that a candidate whose own campaign admits they plan to hit the \"reset\" button like shaking an \"Etch-A-Sketch\" will repeal the very law that is modeled after his own? Freedoms do not change. Our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence were not written in shifting sands, they were signed by the ink of patriots who pledged their lives for liberty. And Conservatives who embrace a return to those founding principles are critical of Romney's plan because it does not reflect the idea of limited government they want to restore. \"It's not simply that Governor Romney and I disagree on government control of healthcare, we clearly don't share a philosophy about the proper role of government,\" Santorum said. \"I am running for President because, at my core, I believe in the greatness of America, the power of free people, and need to restore the principles our Founders risked it all for. America does not need, and cannot afford, a President whose core principles can be shaken away - and I have and always will etch my values, my principles, and core beliefs in stone. Sadly Governor Romney does not share this commitment.\"Conservative commentator MIchelle Malkin wrote, \"I repeat: RomneyCare and ObamaCare share not only the same ideological architects, but similar waiver programs in part set up to benefit Big Labor. (http://michellemalkin.com/2012/01/26/confirmed-romneycare-obamacare/)Experts at the Cato Institute dispute claims that it's \"completely intellectually dishonest\" to compare RomneyCare to ObamaCare. They have cited White House records showing \"senior White House officials had a dozen meetings in 2009 with three health-care advisers and experts who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in2006...One of those meetings, on July 20, 2009, was in the Oval Office and presided over by President Barack Obama, the records show.\"The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we'd done in Massachusetts,\" said Jon Gruber, an MIT economist who advised the Romney administration on health care and who attended five meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. \"They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model\"... (http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/romneycare-making-a-fool-of-every-republican-it-touches-since-2006/)\"Governor Romney can run but he can't hide from the fact that without him, we would not have Obamacare as we know it,\" Santorum said. \"Americans don't want government control of their healthcare, that's why my views of a constitutionally limited government better mirror the values of conservatives and the vision of America.\"Additional information:\"Presidential aspirant Mitt Romney may not have intended that the mandatory health insurance law he signed in 2006 would look like the Obama health law. But the Massachusetts law does a lot more than cover the uninsured (a worthy goal).\" (http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/romneycare-obamacare-healthcare-identical/2012/01/29/id/425900)\"Notice that he didn't answer Mr. Santorum's critique. Instead, he shifted back to his talking points, stressing Mr. Obama's Medicare cuts, the role of federalism, and his own compassion. In other words, he all but conceded Mr. Santorum's point that the two plans are so similar voters will be hard-pressed to tell the difference come November.\" (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204661604577187040872035080.html)\"Mitt Romney has gone to great lengths to distance his Massachusetts health plan from the federal law, even giving a PowerPoint presentation to emphasize the differences. But the truth is that there are an awful lot of similarities between the plan he signed in Massachusetts in 2006, often called \"RomneyCare,\" and the one that President Barack Obama signed in 2010, dubbed \"ObamaCare.\" (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/) (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/paul-krugman/krugman-calls-senate-health-care-bill-similar-law-/) (http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/dec/05/howard-dean/dean-howard-says-health-care-bill-prseident-barack/)     2\n",
              "Business Owner and Community Advocate Nationally Known for Philanthropy in Higher Education The Clinton campaign today announced the endorsement of Nevada System of Higher Education Chancellor James E. Rogers, and named him co-chair of the Nevada campaign. \"Hillary Clinton is a smart, tough and tested leader who believes, as I do, that education is the foundation of a strong society,\" said Rogers. \"Fixing our broken education system will help restore our nation to its place of prominence and leadership in the global marketplace. I know that as president, Senator Clinton will work to broaden access to education and empower innovation. Of all the great candidates in the field this year, she is the most prepared to get America back on track. She has my enthusiastic endorsement, and I'm proud to be a part of her leadership team in Nevada.\" As Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, Rogers serves as chief executive officer for the state's system of eight institutions of higher learning. An active supporter of higher education, he has served on numerous boards and executive committees for colleges and universities across the country. Rogers and his wife, Beverly, have contributed or pledged more than $275 million to various colleges and universities. Their gift of $115 million to the University of Arizona College of Law is to date the largest gift to any American law school. In November 1998, the Arizona Board of Regents renamed the University of Arizona college of Law The James E. Rogers College of Law. Most recently, Rogers was listed as one of the top twelve philanthropists in the Nation by Time Magazine, recognizing his work on behalf of higher education. Beverly Rogers, who recently completed her MA in English Literature and is pursuing her Ph.D. in Literature at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, has made substantial contributions on her own to universities including the English Departments at the University of Arizona and UNLV. Rogers is the founder and owner of Valley Broadcasting Company, which made application in 1971 to the Federal Communications Commission for its first broadcast license. Sunbelt Communications Company, now the parent company, owns and operates 16 NBC and FOX affiliate television stations in five western states. A member of the State Bar Associations of Nevada, Arizona and California, he was in active law practice in Las Vegas until 1988, when he ceased practicing law to devote 100% of his time to the development of the television and radio stations of Sunbelt and various banks. An avid collector of western motion picture memorabilia, antique automobiles and all varieties of western folklore, Rogers serves on the board of the Motion Picture and Television Fund. He is one of the first nine leaders elected to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Business Hall of Fame. \"I can't think of a more passionate advocate for education in the state of Nevada  and even in the nation - than Jim Rogers,\" said Clinton Nevada Chair Rory Reid. \"As a businessman and community leader, Jim has worked to make our state stronger, and encouraged others to do the same. His endorsement makes a strong statement about Hillary Clinton's experience, leadership and commitment to the issues that matter most.\" As State Co-Chair, Rogers joins Clinton's Nevada campaign leadership team, which in addition to Reid includes former Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa, State Treasurer Kate Marshall, Pastor Robert Fowler of Victory Baptist Ministries, Clark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani and Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce Chairman Robert Gomez.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",

Over the fourteen years preceding, the teen birth rate fell by 34 percent. \"Teen pregnancy has damaging effects on teen parents and society. Teen parents are more likely to live in poverty, to drop out of high school, and to rely on public assistance. The sons of teen mothers are more likely to end up in prison; the daughters are more likely to themselves end up as teen parents. According to a report by Dr. Saul D. Hoffman and the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, teen childbearing in the United States cost taxpayers at least $9.1 billion in 2004. \"To address this important issue, my husband issued a call to action in 1995 to America's parents and leaders to join together to cut America's teen pregnancy rate by one-third over a decade. In order to help achieve this ambitious goal, I helped launch the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, and we successfully achieved a one-third reduction by 2005. But the report released today indicates that under President Bush's leadership, we may be falling off track. As President, I will bring a concerted focus to breaking the cycle of teen pregnancy, and in doing so tackle the root cause of many social problems and help to give thousands of young people the

I am fortunate to have been blessed with great genes --- both of my parents had very long and productive lives. I have truly enjoyed working on the campaign trail with one objective in mind, to Make America Great Again! People have been impressed by my stamina, but to me it has been easy because I am truly doing something that I love. Our country will soon be better and stronger than ever before.  Donald J.

Governor Palin is returning to Alaska to be with her husband and looks forward to being back on the campaign trail soon.

Among her many formidable skills is her ability to listen to what Americans are saying about their lives, about their families and about the issues that concern them. Hillary Clinton has translated listening into leadership,\" said Weldon Latham. \"The Democratic Party has great diversity in our candidates, but we need to make sure that we have the best-qualified and most experienced person with a proven track record leading our nation. After eight years of the Bush administration, America deserves the kind of leadership and vision that Hillary Clinton will bring to the presidency,\" added Latham.
